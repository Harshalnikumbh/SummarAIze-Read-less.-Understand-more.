    <h2>Help & Usage Guide</h2>

    <p class="muted">
      Welcome to <strong>SummarAIze</strong> — your AI-powered assistant that simplifies reading by generating concise summaries 
      from any <strong>URL</strong>. Whether you want to quickly grasp the essence of an e-commerce product review 
      or an entire webpage, SummarAIze makes it effortless.
    </p>

    <h3>🧭 How to Use SummarAIze</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Copy the <strong>URL</strong> of the page or product review you want summarized.</li>
      <li>Paste it into the SummarAIze input box on the homepage.</li>
      <li>Click on the <strong>“Summarize”</strong> button and let the AI do its work.</li>
      <li>Within seconds, you’ll receive a clean, concise, and context-rich summary.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>💡 What You Can Summarize</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>E-commerce Reviews:</strong> Summarize long customer feedback into short, meaningful insights to help make better buying decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Web Articles:</strong> Get summaries of news articles, blog posts, research papers, and other web pages without reading everything.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>⚙️ How It Works</h3>
    <p>
      SummarAIze processes the content from your provided URL using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. 
      It identifies the main points, filters redundant details, and produces a human-like summary 
      that captures the key ideas clearly.
    </p>

    <h3>🌟 Tips for Best Results</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure the URL you paste contains readable text (not just images or videos).</li>
      <li>SummarAIze currently supports summarization of public web pages and product reviews only.</li>
      <li>Private or restricted pages may not generate a summary.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🚀 Coming Soon</h3>
    <p>
      Future updates will include features like <strong>tone adjustment</strong>, <strong>multi-language support</strong>, 
      and <strong>custom summary length</strong> — giving you more control over how you read and understand content online.
